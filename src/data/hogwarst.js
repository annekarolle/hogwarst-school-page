  description: [
    "Hogwarts School, located in the Highlands of Scotland, is a vast and magical institution. It comprises Hogwarts Castle, surrounded by beautiful grounds that include lawns, gardens, a lake, a forest, greenhouses, and a Quidditch Pitch. The castle's architecture is impressive, with its highest towers named after Astronomy, Ravenclaw, and Gryffindor. The castle has a rich history and is known for its ever-changing layout, with rooms that sometimes shift position and staircases that move. Its secrets are so vast that even the wise Albus Dumbledore didn't know them all.",
    "To protect the school from danger, Hogwarts is safeguarded by ancient charms and spells. Stealthy entry is prevented, and the school is hidden from Muggle eyes, appearing as old ruins and warnings. Apparition is restricted on the grounds, unless permitted by the Headmaster. The presence of magic at Hogwarts disrupts Muggle technology like computers and electricity, but magical items like radios still function properly.",
    "Hogwarts is a place of wonder, with its enchanting castle, magical grounds, and mysterious history. It serves as a sanctuary for witches and wizards to learn and grow, with its protective enchantments ensuring their safety. The combination of ancient traditions, ever-changing spaces, and the presence of powerful magic makes Hogwarts a unique and cherished institution in the wizarding world.",

  earlyHistory:
    "Hogwarts was founded in 990 A.D. by Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, and Salazar Slytherin. Slytherin's disagreement about blood purity led to his departure and the creation of the Chamber of Secrets. The founders did not hold the title of Headmaster/mistress during their time.",
  middleHistory:
    "Hogwarts became known for its role in protecting dangerous magical objects. The Triwizard Tournament was established around 300 years after the school's founding but was later discontinued due to high death tolls. The invention of Floo powder and the Floo Network introduced new means of transportation within the castle. The Keepers, a group formed by four professors, aimed to safeguard ancient magic. The Chamber of Secrets was concealed behind plumbing fixtures during the 1700s. A failed attempt to trap the poltergeist Peeves resulted in a three-day standoff and unusual privileges for him. In 1890, a new student arrived at Hogwarts as a fifth-year and faced challenges related to ancient magic.",

    "Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry boasted a highly skilled faculty consisting of knowledgeable professors specializing in various subjects. The staff also included positions such as a school nurse, caretaker, librarian, and Keeper of the Keys and Grounds. Students at Hogwarts had the opportunity to study a diverse range of subjects, including core curriculum and elective courses from the third year onwards. Some classes could be dropped in the sixth year. ",
    "Core subjects such as Transfiguration, Defence Against the Dark Arts, Charms, Potions, Astronomy, History of Magic, and Herbology were compulsory for the first five years. From the third year, students were required to choose at least two optional subjects, which included Arithmancy, Study of Ancient Runes, Divination, Care of Magical Creatures, and Muggle Studies. However, the subject of Horcruxes was strictly forbidden at Hogwarts due to its dark and inhumane nature."

evaluantionSystem: [
    "The evaluation system at Hogwarts consisted of routine homework grading, which was similar to that of Muggle students. As students progressed higher in their education, they faced more challenging exams. The Ordinary Wizarding Levels (O.W.L.s) were standardized tests taken by fifth-year students. These exams determined the subjects they could continue studying in their final years at Hogwarts, equivalent to Muggle O-levels.",
    "For exceptional students, there were optional Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Tests (N.E.W.T.s), similar to A-levels for Muggle students. To qualify for N.E.W.T.-level studies, students needed to achieve high marks in their O.W.L. exams. Failing to meet the requirements meant they would not be able to handle the advanced subjects. N.E.W.T. tests were administered in the seventh year and could not be retaken.",
    "The Ordinary Wizarding Level grading system included pass grades: Outstanding (O), Exceeds Expectations (E), and Acceptable (A). Fail grades included Poor (P), Dreadful (D), and Troll (T). Each grade had implications for further study options and academic credit. This grading system was also used in other exams like W.O.M.B.A.T.s, and it was likely employed in N.E.W.T.s as well, making it the universal exam grading system in wizarding Britain.",
 
],
selection: [
    "The selection of students at Hogwarts is done annually by the Deputy Headmaster of the school. He sends acceptance letters to eligible witches and wizards who will be turning eleven years old at the beginning of the upcoming term. These letters invite the children to become students at Hogwarts.",
    "If a letter does not reach its intended recipient, owls are sent to deliver the letters until the person receives one. The letters contain a list of required supplies, such as uniforms, spell books, and cauldrons. Students usually acquire these supplies at Diagon Alley in London",
    "In special cases, such as when the student is a Muggle-born or has particular circumstances, a member of the Hogwarts staff personally delivers the letter to the parents or guardians. This person explains about the wizarding society and assists in obtaining the necessary materials.",
    "Students are allowed to bring a cat, an owl, or a toad as a pet. Exceptions can be made for other types of animals, such as rats and Pygmy Puffs.",
    "Students do not have to pay tuition fees, as the Ministry of Magic covers the cost of all students' magical education.",
  
],
quidditch: [
    "Quidditch is a popular wizarding sport played at Hogwarts and other magical schools. It involves two teams of seven players each, flying on broomsticks, competing to score points and catch the elusive Golden Snitch",
    "At the beginning of the school year, tryouts are held for the House Quidditch teams. The Heads of the houses collect a list of applicants and pass it on to the team captain, who then schedules tryouts. Typically, first-year students are not allowed to join the teams due to their lack of experience with brooms and the prohibition of owning them.",
    "Each team aims to score points by throwing the Quaffle, a ball, through one of the opposing team's three goalposts. Meanwhile, the Seeker's primary objective is to catch the Golden Snitch, a small, fast, and winged ball, which awards a significant number of points and ends the game when caught.",
    "Quidditch matches can be intense and fast-paced, with players performing various maneuvers and strategies to outmaneuver their opponents. The team that scores the most points, including the points gained from capturing the Snitch, wins the game.",
    "Quidditch is not only a competitive sport but also a source of house pride and excitement for the students at Hogwarts. It is an integral part of the wizarding world's culture and provides thrilling entertainment for both players and spectators alike.",
